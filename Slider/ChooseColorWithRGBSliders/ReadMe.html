<p>
	In this example there are three RadSliders, one for each of the three colors in the RGB palette. By dragging the slide handle the color in the 
    square on the right changes. The color also changes if the user taps on the slider scale.
</p>
<p>
    To achieve this, five configuration properties of RadSlider have been used and and event handler has been added to both the change and slide events.
</p>
<p>
    There is a detailed explanation on how this can be achieved in the RadSlider's documentation under the "How To" section.
