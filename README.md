=============

*RadControls for Windows 8 HTML SDK* is an easy-to-use infrastructure with developer focused examples for all controls from the [RadControls for Windows 8 HTML](http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-8/controls-html.aspx) suite by Telerik. Every control has a solution with multiple projects which are the actual examples. Each example has a readme.html file that describes it in a few sentences.
To run the examples you need to install a trial or developer version of [RadControls for Windows 8 HTML](http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-8/controls-html.aspx) and add a reference to it in the project of your interest.
