	This example is in German language. You can choose a min and max for the price span and a date of a flight - the example displays flight 
    tickets offers, that match the search. The global culture is set to "de-DE" and therefore the RadNumericBox and the RadCalendar are with 
    the German culture settings.

	In the current scenario all the text is written in German. The Telerik global culture is set to "de-DE", so the controls can match the 
    language and preferences of the German culture. By changing the culture, the RadCalendar settings are automatically adjusted to the German 
    format preferences, the days of the week and the months are translated. The currency symbol of the RadNumericBox is also changed to euro. Note 
    that a global culture change affects only newly initialized controls. That is why it is important to set the global culture before the 
    processAll() method has initialized the controls. Additionally, the price of the ticket offers is formatted using the 
    Telerik.Utilities.toString() method and is passed the "de-DE" culture to get the euro currency sign.
