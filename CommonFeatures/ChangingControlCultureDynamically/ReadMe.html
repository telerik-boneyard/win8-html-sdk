	This example shows how you can change the culture of the RadControls dynamically. In order to do that, you need to set the culture 
    property of each control individually.

<p>
	In the current scenario you can choose a time span between two months and the RadChart will display the data between these months through a 
    line series. Additionally, you can choose a culture for the RadControls by clicking on one of the buttons above. They change the culture 
    of each control individually. All controls refresh automatically, when their culture property value is changed. The RadChart is the only 
    exception. You need to call its refresh() method manually to refresh it.
