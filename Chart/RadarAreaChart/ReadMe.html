	In this example the radar area series are used to compare multiple product spec ratings. You can choose a CPU model from the RadGrid and click the 'Add' button to add the 
    CPU model to the radar area chart. The data is fetched from a local JSON file, but the same approach can be used to get remote data from a JSON web service. We then calculate 
    the ratings in the code-behind, create RadChart series dynamically and push them to the chart to visualize them. Finally, the 'Clear' button clears all series and you can 
    start anew.
