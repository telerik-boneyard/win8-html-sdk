	This is an example of how you can use RadChart together with RadGrid to show large amount of data in an ordered way. Click on a bar from the RadChart to see 
    more information regarding the selection in a RadGrid. In the current implementation, the RadGrid is hidden at first and it is shown and its data is filtered 
    on the RadChart's "onseriesclick" event.
