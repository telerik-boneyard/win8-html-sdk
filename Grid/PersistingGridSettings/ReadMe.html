	This example shows how you can achieve persistent filtering, grouping and sorting settings in your grid. In the current scenario the user can apply filtering, sorting 
    or grouping and then save these settings. On the next application start, these settings will be applied. The settings are stored in a local .json file and loaded from 
    it on application start.
