	This example shows how you can aggregate data in RadSparkline. In the current scenario the data is aggregated in categories by year. This is done by setting 
    the "aggregate" property of the series to "sum" and setting up the category axis to have the categories by year. Additionally the value axis has been modified 
    to has the "min" and "max" properties set to 3 and 12, which changes the RadSparkline visually.
