	This is an example of how to control RadCalendar programmatically. There are 5 buttons to navigate the RadCalendar through the click event handlers. The 
    first one navigates to a selected date from the RadDatePicker control. The rest navigate up one level, down one level, to the next month/year and to the 
    previous month/year.
