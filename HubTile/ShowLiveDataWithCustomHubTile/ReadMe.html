<p>This example shows a RadCustomHubTile displaying data coming from a remote point.</p>

<p>
	The scenario is achieved by making an xhr request to the Northwind service to retrieve all of the products, and creating a hubtile populated with
a random product from the data. The RadCustomHubTile is initialized after the response is returned and its back content template is populated with the already
available information (We have the images locally and load them by a given id).
</p>

<p>
	Additionally there is a button, that on click gets a new random product item and refreshes the hubtile with it.
